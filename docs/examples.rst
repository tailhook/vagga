   All the examples run in containers and install dependencies in ``.vagga``
   subfolder of project dir. So all that possibly scary dependencies are
   installed automatically and **never touch your host system**. That makes
   it easy to experiment with vagga.

* `Vagga itself`__ -- fairly complex config, includes:

    * *Building* Rust with musl_ libc support
    * Docs using sphinx_ and additional dependencies
    * Running vagga in vagga for tests

* `Presentation`__ config for simple `impress.js`_ presentation generated
  from `restructured text`_ (``.rst``) files. Includes:

    * Installing hovercraft_ by Pip (Python 3), which generates the HTML files
    * The simple ``serve`` command to serve the presentation on HTTP
    * The ``pdf`` command which generates PDF files using wkhtmltopdf_ and some
      complex bash magic

* `xRandom`__ a web project described as "Site that allows you see adult movie
  free without advertisements". Vagga config features:

    * Installation of elasticsearch_ (which is also an example to setup DB)
    * The full web server stack run with single command (nginx + nodejs)
    * The `hard way`_ of setting up the same thing for comparison
